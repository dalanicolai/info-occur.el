#+TITLE: info-occur.el

This package provides an Info-occur search feature, similar to pdf-occur. When
using the `Info-occur' command in an Info buffer, it will search in the manual
of that buffer. Using this command from other modes, it will ask to select one
or multiple manuals to search. To search in multiple manuals directly from an
info buffer prefix the command with a `universal-argument'.

* TODO Fix tablist-operations-function (jump to match)
  - For some reason, despite the form working correctly when evaluating with =M-:=
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (bookmark--jump-via item 'switch-to-buffer-other-window)
   #+end_src 
   this does not jump to the exact location of the entry when using the
    ~tablist-find-entry~ command in the tablist buffer

* TODO Add 'match face property
  For some mysterious reason, the (out-commented) code for adding the =match= face
  property to the text in the tablist does not work

* TODO Small improvements
  - Automatically optimize size of tablist fields (adapt to longest field string)
  - crop the sentences (text) in the tablist to their relevant parts
  - Maybe only add entries for nodes if there are too many matches
